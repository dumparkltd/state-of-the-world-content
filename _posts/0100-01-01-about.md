## A tool to measure human rights progress

The **State of the World** human rights portal is a collaborative initiative by the Universal Rights Group, the Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI) and the SERF Index; supported by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Permanent Mission of Denmark to the United Nations in Geneva.

The **State of the World** portal is designed to allow users to look at the real-world enjoyment of a wide range of human rights (civil, political, economic and social) across over 100 States. To do so it uses objective human rights **indicator data**, meaning the global human rights community can now – for the first time - scrutinise State human rights performance at an empirical level.

As well as allowing users to track human rights implementation and impact, the **State of the World** portal is also expected to contribute to the **prevention** of human rights crises and conflicts, by facilitating the identification of ‘resilience weak spots’ (i.e., areas where a given State may be backsliding), and to UN efforts to monitor progress towards the achievement of the **Sustainable Development Goals** (SDGs) by 2030 (92% of SDG targets are grounded in human rights law).

It is hoped that, through its revolutionary use of hard data, and its cutting-edge ‘visualisation’ graphic interface, the **State of the World** portal will allow diplomats, UN officials and experts, civil society, human rights defenders, journalists, and business leaders making overseas investment decisions, to see, for themselves, whether countries are making measurable progress towards the full enjoyment of the human rights set out in the international bill of rights, or whether – on the contrary – certain States are seeing a national-level regression in the promotion and protection of human rights.

More globally, the portal will allow those interested in human rights and universal values to answer a question that has remained largely unanswered since the foundation of the United Nations three quarters of a century ago: **is the worldwide human rights situation getting better or worse?**

Finally, by strengthening public scrutiny of the degree to which States are fulfilling their legal obligations under the international human rights treaties, the **State of the World** project will also complement similar transparency initiatives (e.g., [yourHRC.org](https://yourhrc.org/)) in holding candidate and member States of the Human Rights Council accountable against the criteria for election and standards of membership set down in GA resolution 60/251.

## The State of the World project has two component parts:

### State of the World web portal

A universally accessible and free-to-use ‘State of the World web portal’ presenting human rights and democracy indicator data for, and showcasing the human rights performance of, over 100 UN member States. The portal allows users to access: an at-a-glance overview of human rights trends around the world (including current levels of enjoyment of human rights, as well as trends since 2007 for economic and social rights, and trends since 2017 for civil and political rights); country performance for five high-level principles of democracy; region-by-region analyses showing human rights and democracy trends for each UN regional group; and country-by-country analyses showing the degree to which each State is implementing its international human rights obligations and commitments, as well as the impact of implementation measures on democracy, human life, dignity and rights.

The web portal is based on HRMI’s [Rights Tracker](https://rightstracker.org) and is also licenced under the same [Open Source license](https://github.com/dumparkltd/state-of-the-world/blob/master/LICENSE.md). Its source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/dumparkltd/state-of-the-world).

### State of the World annual report

A ‘State of the World annual report’ highlighting key human rights and democracy trends over the course of the year, and ‘digging down’ to understand particularly important or interesting trends at global, regional or national levels. In addition to boosting transparency and public accountability, by sharing good practices and promoting ‘human rights stories’, the report is also expected to contribute to forward momentum in the domestic implementation of international human rights standards (as well as SDG commitments). Finally, the report, like the portal, is expected to boost public interest in, understanding of, and support for, the international human rights system – by drawing a clear link between UN-level instruments, mechanisms and decisions, and the lived everyday reality of millions of people around the world. The ‘State of the World annual report’ will be published each December, and launched at events in Geneva and New York.

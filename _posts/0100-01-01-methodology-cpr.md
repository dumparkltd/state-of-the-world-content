## HRMI's civil and political rights’ scores

### Country scores

Civil and political rights measurement is based on a multilingual expert survey approach where country scores are based on responses of human rights experts who either live in or specialise in monitoring that country.

In addition to the **median value** of all quantified expert responses, 80% **credible intervals** are given (10th and 90th percentile) to reflect a possible disagreement and the resulting uncertainty about the true score. While smaller credible intervals thus indicate strong agreement of the experts, longer intervals indicate less agreement.

While HRMI is working on expanding their data to the whole world as soon as possible, coverage is currently still quite limited (learn how you can help [here](https://humanrightsmeasurement.org/do-you-want-hrmi-human-rights-scores-for-your-country)).

### Regional and global averages

To expose regional and global trends, we have calculated the average scores for each of the five UN regional groupings as well as the world using all available country scores.

Please note:

* HRMI's **country coverage** for civil and political rights is still rather limited so that regional score averages are likely not (yet) representative or may even be missing.
* In addition of the (mean) averages of the median country scores, 80% **credible intervals** are given for each region based on the individual countries' standard variations (the regional standard variation is the square root of the quadratic mean of the countries' standard variations).  

### Interpreting civil and political rights scores

To help with interpreting the scores HRMI has defined broad qualitative ranges. They are however only an indication of a country’s performance and NOT comprehensive descriptions.

#### Good: 8 - 10

Governments with scores in the good range respect these rights more than most other governments in our sample since 2017. However, countries in this range, particularly those with scores close to the lower end of the range, may still have significant problems that lead to the violation of some peoples’ rights.

#### Fair: 6 - 8

Governments with scores in the fair range respect these rights more than many countries since 2017, but still violate the rights of a significant number of people.

#### Bad: 3.5 - 6

Governments with scores in the bad range engage in numerous violations of civil and political rights, performing worse than many governments in our sample since 2017.

#### Very bad: 0 - 3.5

Governments with scores in the very bad range violate these rights more than most other governments in our sample since 2017.

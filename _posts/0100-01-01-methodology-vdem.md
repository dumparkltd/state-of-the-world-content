## V-Dem's democracy scores

### Country scores

TODO: something about V-Dem's methodology (consider mentioning not including disputed "countries", eg Kosovo, Somaliland, Kongkong, Taiwan, Palestine?)

### Regional and global averages

TODO: consider method for credible intervals and describe here

To expose regional and global trends, we have calculated the average scores for each of the five UN regional groupings as well as the world using all available country scores.

Please note:

* In addition of the (mean) averages of the median country scores, 68% **credible intervals** are given for each region based on the individual countries' standard variations (the regional standard variation is the square root of the quadratic mean of the countries' standard variations).  

### Interpreting democracy scores

TODO: consider option for qualitative brackets (V-Dem scores range from 0 to 1) and rewrite or remove this section

To help with interpreting the scores HRMI has defined broad qualitative ranges. They are however only an indication of a countryâ€™s performance and NOT comprehensive descriptions.

#### Good: 95 - 100%

Countries scoring 100% set the benchmark for what is possible at any income level. These are usually high income countries who are demonstrating what is possible to achieve with sufficient income and given current technologies and knowledge. These countries will not be perfect, but are showing what it is so far possible to achieve. Countries scoring more than 95 but less than 100 have enabled people to broadly claim the right concerned, but, as in every country, there will still be some vulnerable population subgroups that are unable to claim their rights.

#### Fair: 85 - 95%

Countries scoring in this range likely enable the majority of people to claim the right concerned but there remain segments of the population that are unable to do so.

#### Bad: 75 - 85%

Countries scoring in this range have a long way to go to ensure that most people enjoy the right concerned, and there remain substantial segments of society that are unable to do so.  

#### Very bad: 0 - 75%

In countries scoring in this range, broad segments of society are unable to claim the right concerned. These countries are likely very low income countries, or countries that have failed to put in place the kinds of structures and policies that help people claim the right concerned, or both.

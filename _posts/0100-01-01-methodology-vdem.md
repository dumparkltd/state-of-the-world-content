## V-Dem's democracy scores

### Country scores

V-Dem draws on theoretical and methodological expertise from its worldwide team to produce data in the most objective and reliable way possible. Approximately half of the indicators in the V-Dem dataset are based on factual information obtainable from official documents such as constitutions and government records. The other half consists of more subjective assessments on topics like political practices and compliance with de jure rules. On such issues, typically five experts provide ratings.

V-Dem works closely with leading social science research methodologists and has developed a state of the art measurement model that, to the extent possible, minimizes coder error and addresses issues of comparability across countries and over time. V-Dem also draws on the team’s academic expertise to develop theoretically informed techniques for aggregating indicators into mid- and high-level indices. In this sense, V-Dem is at the cutting edge of developing new and improved methods of social science measurement.

V-Dem measures different democracy-related indicators by aggregating expert judgments. V-Dem has recruited over 3,000 country experts to provide their judgment on different concepts and cases and typically gathers data from 5 experts for each observation and uses different techniques to facilitate cross-country comparability.

In addition to the median value of all quantified expert responses, 68% credible intervals are given to reflect a possible disagreement and the resulting uncertainty about the true score. While smaller credible intervals thus indicate strong agreement of the experts, longer intervals indicate less agreement.

More information about V-Dem's methodology can be found in their Organisation and Management [manual](https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/b6/57/b657b62d-b3a5-41b5-85bb-48e8d8db0a3d/org__man_v111.pdf), methodology [handbook](https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/4e/1c/4e1c47ae-4800-436a-bbf1-c5fb50798bd3/methodology_v111.pdf) and overview of its [Method for Aggregating Expert-Coded Data](https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/96/82/9682e043-d302-4e90-b927-3f37e8469acd/v-dem_policybrief_17_2018.pdf).

### Regional and global averages

To expose regional and global trends, we have calculated the average scores for each of the five UN regional groupings as well as the world using all available country scores.

Please note:

* In addition of the (mean) averages of the median country scores, 68% **credible intervals** are given for each region based on the individual countries' standard variations (the regional standard variation is the square root of the quadratic mean of the countries' standard variations).  

### Interpreting V-Dem's democracy scores

For all indices, V-Dem uses interval scale from 0-1, where 0 is the lowest (i.e., the corresponding democracy index is the less realised) and 1 is the highest (i.e., the corresponding democracy index is the further realised).

## V-Dem's democracy scores

### Country scores

V-Dem measures different democracy-related indicators by aggregating expert judgments. V-Dem has recruited over 3,000 country experts to provide their judgment on different concepts and cases and typically gathers data from 5 experts for each observation and uses different techniques to facilitate cross-country comparability.

In addition to the median value of all quantified expert responses, 68% credible intervals are given to reflect a possible disagreement and the resulting uncertainty about the true score. While smaller credible intervals thus indicate strong agreement of the experts, longer intervals indicate less agreement.

More information about V-Dem's methodology can be found in their methodology [handbook](https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/94/87/94876a61-1682-4227-baa0-ab927645d507/method.pdf) and overview of its [Method for Aggregating Expert-Coded Data](https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/96/82/9682e043-d302-4e90-b927-3f37e8469acd/v-dem_policybrief_17_2018.pdf).

### Regional and global averages

To expose regional and global trends, we have calculated the average scores for each of the five UN regional groupings as well as the world using all available country scores.

Please note:

* In addition of the (mean) averages of the median country scores, 68% **credible intervals** are given for each region based on the individual countries' standard variations (the regional standard variation is the square root of the quadratic mean of the countries' standard variations).  

### Interpreting V-Dem's democracy scores

For all indices, V-Dem uses interval scale from 0-1, where 0 is the lowest (i.e., the corresponding democracy index is the less realised) and 1 is the highest (i.e., the corresponding democracy index is the further realised).

Human Rights measurement data shown in the portal is produced by HRMI, a unique collaborative venture between human rights practitioners, researchers, academics, and other human rights supporters. HRMI’s goal is to produce the first comprehensive set of measurements for tracking the human rights performance of countries.

## Measuring economic and social rights

### Country scores

For economic and social rights, HRMI draws on the most recently available national statistics produced by governments and international agencies.

For the **State of the World** human rights portal we only use the **Global Best** benchmark where the maximum possible score (100%) is based on the best outcome achieved by any country regardless of its available income. Please refer to HRMI's [Rights Tracker](https://rightstracker.org) for **Income-adjusted** scores that compare countries’ human rights outcomes with countries at a similar income level, thus capturing the concept of 'progressive realisation'.

Due to differences in data availability for high income and low and middle income countries, economic and social rights scores are measured for two **assessment standards** that each draw on different sets of statistical indicators:    

* **Low and middle income**: Uses statistical indicators that are available for most countries in the world, particularly low and middle income countries.
* **High income**: Uses statistical indicators that are primarily available for high income countries, and better reflect the human rights challenges of high income countries.

* [In-depth methodology handbook](https://humanrightsmeasurement.org/methodology-handbook/)
* [SERF Index website](https://serfindex.uconn.edu/)

### Regional and global averages

To expose regional and global trends, we have calculated the average scores (mean) for each of the five UN regional groupings as well as the world for both assessment standards using all available country scores.

Please note:

* HRMI's **country coverage** varies greatly by UN regional group and assessment standard so that regional score averages may not be representative or may even be missing.
* Where statistical indicators are not available for a given year, HRMI's country scores are based on the most recently available statistical indicators and may thus be slightly outdated. As a consequence, a **regional bias** may be introduced where data are more outdated for countries of a particular UN regional group.

### Interpreting economic and social rights scores (global best benchmark)

To help with interpreting the scores HRMI has defined broad qualitative ranges. They are however only an indication of a country’s performance and NOT comprehensive descriptions.

**95-100%: Good**

Countries scoring 100% set the benchmark for what is possible at any income level. These are usually high income countries who are demonstrating what is possible to achieve with sufficient income and given current technologies and knowledge. These countries will not be perfect, but are showing what it is so far possible to achieve. Countries scoring more than 95 but less than 100 have enabled people to broadly claim the right concerned, but, as in every country, there will still be some vulnerable population subgroups that are unable to claim their rights.

**85-94.9%: Fair**

Countries scoring in this range likely enable the majority of people to claim the right concerned but there remain segments of the population that are unable to do so.

**75-84.9%: Bad**

Countries scoring in this range have a long way to go to ensure that most people enjoy the right concerned, and there remain substantial segments of society that are unable to do so.  

**0-75%: Very bad**

In countries scoring in this range, broad segments of society are unable to claim the right concerned. These countries are likely very low income countries, or countries that have failed to put in place the kinds of structures and policies that help people claim the right concerned, or both.

## Civil and political rights’ scores

### Country scores

Civil and political rights measurement is based on a multilingual expert survey approach where country scores are based on responses of human rights experts who either live in or specialise in monitoring that country.

In addition to the **median value** of all quantified expert responses, 80% **credible intervals** are given (10th and 90th percentile) to reflect a possible disagreement and the resulting uncertainty about the true score. While smaller credible intervals thus indicate strong agreement of the experts, longer intervals indicate less agreement.

While HRMI is working on expanding their data to the whole world as soon as possible, coverage is currently still quite limited (learn how you can help [here](https://humanrightsmeasurement.org/do-you-want-hrmi-human-rights-scores-for-your-country)).

### Regional and global averages

To expose regional and global trends, we have calculated the average scores for each of the five UN regional groupings as well as the world using all available country scores.

Please note:

* HRMI's **country coverage** for civil and political rights is still rather limited so that regional score averages are likely not (yet) representative or may even be missing.
* In addition of the (mean) averages of the median country scores, 80% **credible intervals** are given for each region based on the individual countries' standard variations (the regional standard variation is the square root of the quadratic mean of the countries' standard variations).  

### Interpreting civil and political rights scores

To help with interpreting the scores HRMI has defined broad qualitative ranges. They are however only an indication of a country’s performance and NOT comprehensive descriptions.

**8-10: Good**

Governments with scores in the **good** range respect these rights more than most other governments in our sample since 2017. However, countries in this range, particularly those with scores close to the lower end of the range, may still have significant problems that lead to the violation of some peoples’ rights.

**6-8: Fair**

Governments with scores in the **fair** range respect these rights more than many countries since 2017, but still violate the rights of a significant number of people.

**3.5-6: Bad**

Governments with scores in the **bad** range engage in numerous violations of civil and political rights, performing worse than many governments in our sample since 2017.

**0-3.5: Very bad**

Governments with scores in the **very bad** range violate these rights more than most other governments in our sample since 2017.

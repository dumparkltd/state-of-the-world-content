Human Rights measurement data shown in the portal is produced by HRMI, a unique collaborative venture between human rights practitioners, researchers, academics, and other human rights supporters. HRMIâ€™s goal is to produce the first comprehensive set of measurements for tracking the human rights performance of countries. For more information about HRMI click [here](https://humanrightsmeasurement.org).  

Democracy measurement data shown in the portal is produced by varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), a new approach to conceptualizing and measuring democracy. V-Dem provides a multidimensional and disaggregated dataset that reflects the complexity of the concept of democracy as a system of rule that goes beyond the simple presence of elections. The V-Dem project distinguishes between five high-level principles of democracy: electoral, liberal, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian, and collects data to measure these principles.

There is no one-size-fits-all methodology for measuring human rights performance, so we use different methodologies that are best tailored to each area.

Wherever possible – e.g. in the area of economic and social rights – our methodologies use objective statistics produced by national governments and international agencies.

For civil and political rights, where violations often take place in secret and reporting is very patchy, we use an expert survey approach to get our information directly from the human rights experts who are monitoring events in each country.

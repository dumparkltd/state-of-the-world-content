When asked to provide more context about who was especially vulnerable to death penalty executions by government agents in 2018, our respondents mentioned all of the following:
-	The law was amended in 2008 which reintroduced the death penalty for certain crimes. While people have been sentenced to death since then, no one has been executed. 
-	Approximately 15 people are currently sentenced to death in Liberia.

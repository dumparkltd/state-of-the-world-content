When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to education in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:  

- Indigenous people (Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders), who many times don’t have access to education in their mother tongue, or access to education at all 
- Asylum seekers and refugees, particularly those without income support or those who are homeless 
- People living in remote areas 
- People of low social or economic status 
- Homeless people 
- People with disabilities 
- Immigrants, particularly children on temporary visas
- The cost of primary, secondary, and university educations limit the right to education 
- Those from poorer states or communities often have less quality education than richer states and communities

When asked to provide more context about who was especially vulnerable to restrictions on their political participation by the government or its agents in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:  

- Everyone was at significant risk, as people cannot vote for the US President or have representation in Congress 
- People of certain races or ethnicities, particularly ethnic minorities from other Micronesian islands like the Federated States of Micronesia thanks to widespread prejudice and institutional barriers  
- Homeless people 
- People with low social or economic status 
- People with government jobs, who have limitations on political activities and involvement
